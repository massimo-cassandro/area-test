# SSG with Webpack and Markdown

Example of a small site built server-side using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [html-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader), [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) and [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/).

The contents of the `test.md` file were added twice: using client-side js (top) and during compilation (TODO: fix img path resolving).
